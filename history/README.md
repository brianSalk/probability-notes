# History

**Leibniz's Error**: Leibniz erroniously thought that if you roll $2$ dice, the dots on the dice have the same chance or summing up to $11$ and $12$.  He forgot to give each die a unique label.  
**Treize**: A game where you have a deck of $n$ shuffled cards, labeled $1$ through $n$.  You count outloud each number as you flip a card.  You win if you say the number that is on the card.
