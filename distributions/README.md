# Distributions
## Normal distribution
A continuous distribution that is symmetric and has a bell shape.  This distribution shows up all over nature.  
If you sample ***virtually any*** distribution and take the mean of the samples, those sample means will approximate a normal distribution.  
## Binomial distribution
A discrete distribution that represents the probability of getting $r$ successes out of $n$ trials with probability of success $p$.  
When $p$ is close to $0.5$ and $n$ is arbitrarily large, the binomial distribution approximates the normal distribution.  
## Bernouli distribution
A special case of the binomial distribtution where $n=1$.  
## Poisson distribution
A discrete probability distribution that gives the probability of getting $k$ successes in a period of time, given the $\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the probabilty that that event happens once in a period of time.
