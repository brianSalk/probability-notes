# Expectation
## Expected Value
The expected value is the mean value you would get if you ran the experiment over and over.  
If two distributions are identical, they have the same expected value but *vis-versa* is not true, two very different distributions can have the same expected value.  
the expected value of a r.v. of a distribution is expressed as $E(X)$ or $E[X]$.  
Do not confuse $E(x)$ with the r.v. $X$.  These are two different things.  A random variable is a function and the expected value is a value.  
A radndm variable tells you something about the variation.  
## Notation
the notation $E(X)$ is often abreviated to $EX$, meaning that $EX^2$ means the mean of the function $X^2$, not $(EX)^2$
## Linearity
If we have $2$ random variables, $X$ and $Y$, the following holds
```math
E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)
```
and if you have a constant $c$, 
```math
cE(X) = E(cX)
```
We can find the average in a *grouped* or *ungrouped* way.
