# Expectation
The expected value is the mean value you would get if you ran the experiment over and over.  
If two distributions are identical, they have the same expected value but *vis-versa* is not true, two very different distributions can have the same expected value.  
the expected value of a r.v. of a distribution is expressed as $E(X)$ or $E[X]$.
