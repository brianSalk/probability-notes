# Conditional Probability

```math
P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
```
**First step analysis**: A strategy for finding recursive solutions to multi-step problems.  
**Prior Probability**: The probability of an event before we update our probability with evidence.  
**Posterior Probability**: The probability of an event after we update our belief with evidence.  
**Intersection**: It is common to use both , and $\cap$ to represent intersection.  
```math
P(A,B) = P(A \cap B)
```
**Intersection of n events**: 
```math
P(A,B,C,D) = P(A)\; P(B|A) \; P(C|A,B) \; P(D|A,B,C)
```
